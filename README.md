This package is a part of the class work that was done in collaboration with Ms. Negar Soleimani in the course of Bayesian network analysis taught by Dr. Rezaei Tabar.
During the Course We found out that there is not a function for implementing K2 algorithm for structural learning in bayesian network, So we implemented itðŸ˜‰.

I hope you find it useful.
